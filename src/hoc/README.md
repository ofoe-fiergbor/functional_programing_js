# Functional Composition

Function composition is a way of combining pure functions to build more complicated ones. Like the usual composition of functions in mathematics, the result of one function is passed as the argument of the next, and the result of last one is the result of the whole.

Composition is often used in mathematics, written ``f(g(x))``. Here the ``function g`` is called with a value of ``x``, and then the result of `g` is passed to the `function f`.
